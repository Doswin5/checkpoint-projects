      <h3>Segment Tree</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Lack of practical scenarios where I needed it. It is complex to implement and understand, especially lazy propagation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Watch tutorials and solve problems related to range queries.
      </p>

      <h3>Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Lack of practical scenarios where I needed it. It is complex to implement and understand, especially lazy propagation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Practice prefix sum and dynamic range query problems.
      </p>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Trie (Prefix Tree)</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Haven’t implemented it before; only know theoretical applications like autocomplete or word search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Work on problems related to string manipulation and prefix queries.

    <h1>Unfamiliar Sorting Algorithms:</h1>
    <div class="">
      <h3>Counting Sort</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Haven’t used non-comparison-based sorting algorithms frequently. Struggled to grasp its limited use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Study problems where Counting Sort is optimal, like sorting small integer ranges.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3>Radix Sort</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Never needed it for practical applications. Found its digit-by-digit sorting logic hard to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Understand its relationship with Counting Sort and apply it in practice problems.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3>Heap Sort</h3>
      <p>
        Why Not Mastered: Familiar with heaps but rarely use Heap Sort in real-world projects. Its in-place sorting approach is still unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to Learn: Implement the algorithm manually and understand its heapify process.
